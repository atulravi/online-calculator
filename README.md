# online-calculator
An online calculator I developed with some fundamental physics operations and a very nice background.

Fork This and add features of your choice.

The background has been stolen from someone's codepen (I no longer remember who's to credit). 

Still available at https://esccrasci.in/calculator/ since 2020 and archived since 2021.

Built With CSS, JS and HTML
